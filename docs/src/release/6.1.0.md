## Changes from 6.0.0 to 6.1.0-dev (work in progress)

### Integrated Components

* Yocto 4.0 LTS "Kirkstone" (4.0.10). Layers compatible with 3.1 LTS "Dunfell"
* Linux 6.1 LTS (6.1.29+) with KED backports and patches

### Core/Distro Changes (all HW Platforms)

* Deactivate start of virtual terminal on `tty0` in `ked` distro (`USE_VT =
  "0"`)
* Improve CI configuration
* Fix `xxd` host tool dependency (move to `goodix-touchconfig` recipe)

### Changes for i.MX Platforms

* Improve devshell settings for `u-boot-ktn` and `linux-ktn`
* Enable `CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG` in `linux-ktn`
* Fix an issue with fitImage selection in A/B boot flow

#### Changes for i.MX8 Platform

* Add support for OSM-S/BL i.MX8MP hardware

#### Changes for i.MX6 Platform

* Add support for DPI display interface on BL boards (configuration
  `imx6ull-kontron-dl`)
* U-Boot: Change default device tree boot configuration from `imx6ul-kontron-bl`
  to `imx6ull-kontron-dl`
* Linux: Changes in kernel config
  * Virtual terminals deactivated (`CONFIG_VT`)
  * Most resistive touch drivers removed

### Changes for STM32MP1 Platform

* none

### Breaking Changes

* i.MX6: Default u-boot configuration changed from SOC `ul` variant to `ull`
  variant. So for `ul` variants the boot config has to be adapted manually in
  u-boot environment now!

### Known Issues

* The onboard USB hub on the BL i.MX8MM doesn't work in U-Boot.
* The fw_getenv/setenv tools can't deal with the different possibilities for
  the location of the U-Boot environment on i.MX8MM (SPI NOR, SD card, eMMC).
* If the U-Boot environment for i.MX8MM is placed in the eMMC hardware partition
  (boot0) it is not aligned to the end of the partition, but uses the same
  fixed offset as on SPI NOR and SD card.
* Devices connected to the USB-C connector of the BL i.MX8MP before booting up
  the board are not detected and need to be reconnected after booting.

[^1]: Basic support doesn't include all features of the board. Especially
      advanced peripherals like display, graphics, hardware acceleration units,
      camera interfaces, etc. might not be supported or tested yet.
