### Core/Distro Changes (all HW Platforms)

* Start of virtual terminal on `tty0` deactivated in `ked` distro (`USE_VT =
  "0"`)

### Changes for i.MX8 Platform

* none

### Changes for i.MX6 Platform

* Added support for DPI display interface on BL boards (configuration `imx6ull-kontron-dl`)
* u-boot: Default device tree boot configuration changed from `imx6ul-kontron-bl`
  to `imx6ull-kontron-dl`
* linux: Changes in kernel config
  * Virtual terminals deactivated (`CONFIG_VT`)
  * Most resistive touch drivers removed

### Changes for STM32MP1 Platform

* none

### Breaking Changes

* i.MX6: Default u-boot configuration changed from SOC `ul` variant to `ull`
  variant. So for `ul` variants the boot config has to be adapted manually in
  u-boot environment now!

### Known Issues

* none

[^1]: Basic support doesn't include all features of the board. Especially
      advanced peripherals like display, graphics, hardware acceleration units,
      camera interfaces, etc. might not be supported or tested yet.
